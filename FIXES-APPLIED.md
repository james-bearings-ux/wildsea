# Damage Types Feature - Fixes Applied

## Summary

Based on user feedback from initial testing, the following issues were identified and resolved:

---

## ✅ Fix 1: Advancement Mode - Missing Selectors (CRITICAL)

### Issue
Damage type selectors were not appearing in advancement mode, making it impossible to:
- Complete incomplete selections from creation mode
- Modify existing damage type selections
- Select damage types for newly added aspects

### Solution
Added damage type components to advancement mode rendering.

**Files Modified:**
- `js/rendering/advancement-mode.js`

**Changes:**
1. Added imports for damage type components
2. Updated aspect card rendering (all 3 columns: bloodline/origin/post)
3. Added description highlighting
4. Added warning pills for incomplete selections
5. Added damage type selectors (with mode='advancement')
6. Added selected types display

**Result:** ✅ Advancement mode now has full damage type selection capability

---

## ✅ Fix 2: "X or Y" Logic Update

### Issue
Aspects with damage descriptions like "deals CQ Blunt or Spike damage" were incorrectly treated as requiring player choice during character creation.

### User Clarification
When an aspect says "X or Y" **without** explicit "choose" language:
- Both damage types are inherent to the aspect
- Player chooses which to use during play (narrative choice)
- No permanent selection needed
- Both should appear in summaries

### Solution
Updated parsing logic to treat "or" the same as "and" - both indicate fixed/available damage types.

**Files Modified:**
1. `js/constants/damage-types.js` - Updated `parseDamageTypesFromDescription()` function
2. `public/data/aspects-enhanced.json` - Updated 2 aspects in test subset:
   - Demolisher: `selectionType: "choose"` → `selectionType: "fixed"`
   - Torpedo Mallet: `selectionType: "choose"` → `selectionType: "fixed"`

**Before:**
```javascript
// Incorrectly treated "or" as a choice
const isChoice = typeString.includes(' or ');
selectionType: isChoice ? 'choose' : 'fixed'
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Both "and" and "or" mean damage types are available
// Only aspects with explicit "choose" language require selection
selectionType: 'fixed'
```

**Result:** ✅ "X or Y" damage types now correctly show as fixed options, not requiring selection

---

## ✅ Fix 3: Customize Aspect Interaction (Updated)

### Issue
Need to reprocess damage types when a player modifies an aspect's description through customization.

### Solution
**Decision:** Damage types are reparsed from the new description after customization.

**Rationale:**
- Players may want to customize both narrative and mechanical aspects
- Reparsing allows full mechanical customization
- Valid selections are preserved when compatible with new metadata
- Supports custom aspects and homebrew content

**Documentation Created/Updated:**
- `DAMAGE-TYPES-CUSTOMIZATION-NOTES.md` - Full documentation of reparsing behavior

**Implementation:**
**Files Modified:**
- `js/state/character.js` - Added import and reparsing logic to `customizeAspect()`

**Changes:**
1. Import `parseDamageTypesFromDescription` from damage-types.js
2. After updating description, call parser on new text
3. If new damage types found:
   - Update `damageTypes` metadata
   - Filter `selectedDamageTypes` to keep only still-valid selections
4. If no damage types found:
   - Delete `damageTypes` metadata
   - Clear `selectedDamageTypes`

**Example:**
- Player customizes "Driftwood Core" description to include "immunity to Keen damage"
- Parser detects new damage type pattern
- Metadata updated: `category: "immunity", options: ["Keen"]`
- Previous resistance selections cleared (no longer valid)
- Player can now make new selections based on updated metadata

**Result:** ✅ Damage types dynamically reparse on customization, enabling full mechanical flexibility

---

## ✅ Fix 4: Legacy Character Handling

### Issue
Characters created before damage types feature don't have damage type data.

### Solution
**Decision:** Graceful degradation - no errors, feature simply doesn't show for legacy data.

**Current Behavior:**
- Legacy characters load without errors
- Aspects without damage types render normally
- Damage summary hidden if no data available
- No warnings or indicators (not critical per user)

**Backwards Compatibility:**
- All components check for data existence before rendering
- `selectedDamageTypes` initialized as empty array on new selections
- Summary returns empty string if no defensive types found
- Play mode works perfectly with mixed legacy/new data

**Migration Path (Optional):**
1. Enter advancement mode
2. Deselect and reselect aspects
3. Make damage type selections
4. Save character

**Limitation:** Only works for aspects in `aspects-enhanced.json` (Ketra/Ridgeback/Crash currently)

**Result:** ✅ Documented limitation, graceful handling confirmed

---

## Additional Fix: Naming Mismatch Bug

### Issue
App failed to load with error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')"

### Root Cause
Function `getCharacterDefenses()` returns plural property names but `renderDamageSummary()` was destructuring singular names.

### Solution
Updated `renderDamageSummary()` and `renderCompactDamageSummary()` to use correct plural names.

**Files Modified:**
- `js/components/damage-summary.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
const { resistance, immunity, weakness } = getCharacterDefenses(char);
```

**After:**
```javascript
const { resistances, immunities, weaknesses } = getCharacterDefenses(char);
```

**Result:** ✅ App loads successfully, summary displays correctly

## Testing Recommendations

### Test advancement mode:
1. Create character with incomplete damage type selection
2. Enter advancement mode
3. Verify selector appears
4. Complete selection
5. Verify saves correctly

### Test "or" damage types:
1. Select Demolisher or Torpedo Mallet
2. Verify no selector appears (both types automatic)
3. Enter play mode
4. Verify both types show in summary

### Test customization:
1. Select aspect with damage types
2. Choose damage types
3. Customize aspect (change description)
4. Verify damage types still work
5. Enter play mode
6. Verify summary shows correctly

### Test legacy compatibility:
1. Load pre-existing character (if available)
2. Verify no console errors
3. Verify app renders normally
4. Verify aspects without damage types work fine
