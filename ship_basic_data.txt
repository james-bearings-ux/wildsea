Ships start with a 1 in every rating. 

## Ratings

========
NAME
DESCRIPTION
========

Armour

A measure of your ship’s resistance to damage. You’ll likely roll your armour rating when a larger creature attacks your ship, when you’re fired on by pirates, or when you brute-force the ship through a hazardous area of the sea.

Seals

A measure of how well your ship keeps the wildsea out while travelling. You’ll likely roll your seals rating when there’s a sporestorm, insect swarm, or other potentially invasive presence.

Speed

The speed of your ship when the engines are running smoothly. You’ll likely roll your speed rating when attempting to outrun a pursuer or weather pattern, or if you somehow find yourself in a race.

Saws

How good your ship is at cutting through the denser parts of the sea. You’ll likely roll your saws rating when cutting through thicker areas of the sea or trying to ram other ships.

Stealth

Your ship’s ability to run low, sleek, and undetected. You’ll likely roll your stealth rating when trying to minimize the noise of your engine or the trail you leave, or when trying to avoid the notice of distant threats.

Tilt

A measure of manoeuvrability, and how well your ship can tackle the sharper dips and rises of the waves. You’ll likely roll your tilt rating when tackling one of the larger treetop waves, when diving down into the tangle to evade a pursuer, or when trying to keep steady during a rootquake or storm.

Nano 

1 Stake

Suited for a single sailor and maybe a passenger or two. Perfect for the lone wildsailor, possessed of excess bravery (or a deathwish).

- Stealth +1

Small 

1 Stake

Suited for 2-4 people, cramped but serviceable for double that. Ideal for a first ship.

- Speed +1

Standard 

1 Stake

Comfortable for 5-10 people, but can hold double that number if necessary. The majority of ships out on the Wildsea are of standard size, hence the name.

- Armour +1

Large 

1 Stake

Can house 10-20 crew with room to spare, many more if necessary, depending on the internal designs and additional fittings. Large ships are most often used to patrol trade-routes around more lawful areas, or to transport settlers and research teams for large factions.

- Armour +1

- Stealth -1

## Frames

Sturdy 

1 Stake

Built to last in a place of temporary things, a sturdy frame helps weather the strongest assaults.

1 Stake

Often wedge or blade-shaped, scything frames are constructed specifically to cut as efficiently as possible through the waves.

1 Stake

Built for adjustability and responsiveness, flexible frames are often multi-segmented or jointed in some way.

- Tilt +1

- Armour +1

- Speed +1

Junk-Strung 

0 Stakes

The mark of a ship well-scarred and oft-repaired, a junk-strung hull is barely a hull at all... More a collection of scavenged metal, driftwood, and animal bones; unstable, rusting, and leaky.

- Armour +1

- Seals -1

Floraflage 

2 Stakes

A hull of living vegetation grown purposefully around your frame. Blends easily into the seascape.

Transport 

2 Stakes

- Built-in passenger quarters with varying levels of comfort

- A sturdily constructed panic room, suitable for holding passengers unwilling to fight in the event the ship is attacked or boarded

Hauling

Just as essential as transporting passengers, the movement and trading of cargo is a reliable path to success for dependable types. These ships will likely have...

- Gangplanks, winches, and bay doors for swift loading and unloading at port

- An expanded cargo area with extra security and webbing for odd-shaped packages

- A reliable cargo crane built into the ship's structure for holding and transporting particularly heavy crates and objects

Hunting 

2 Stakes

The oldest wildsea profession, a ship kitted out with a hunting motif will likely have...

- Trophies of bone, fur, or chitin prominently displayed on the outer hull

- A modified cargo area complete with animal pens

- An array of hunting and butchery tools, allowing crew fighting on or below decks easy access to CQ Keen or Spike damage

Salvaging 

2 Stakes

Useful for scrappers, dredgers, and wreck-wranglers, salvaging ships will likely have...

- A scratched and dented appearance, making you look almost like a wreck yourself

- A modified cargo area with work benches and tools for disassembly

Pathfinding 

2 Stakes

Pathfinding ships are built with tenacious exploration in mind, and will likely have...

For wildsailors who take to the waves with violence in mind, for noble or not-so-noble reasons. Ships with a raiding motif will likely have...

- Fortified deck-rails to give the crew cover while shooting (or being shot at)

- Bulkhead doors that can be closed and locked to isolate boarding parties

- An armoury lockbox containing weapons taken as spoils from previous encounters, allowing crew fighting on or below decks easy access to Blunt or Blast damage

Rescue 

2 Stakes

Yours is the kind of ship people call on when other ships don't make it back to port. Ships with a rescue motif will likely have...

- Emergency medicine for some of the more common maladies of the waves

- A photoscope for picking out glints of wreckage or distress flares at a great distance

- An isolation room packed with soft amber resin, for keeping the crew insulated from and slowing the progress of illnesses during a journey

Research 

2 Stakes

The mysteries of the rustling waves are an egg waiting to hatch, and a research vessel is just the right sort of tool to crack them right open. Research ships will likely have...

- A higher level of general technology on show than average

- A library for recording new findings and delving into secrets and lore

- A snapograph arrangement, a complex deck-mounted photography system for catching images of the waves and printing them on light-sensitive paper

Entertainment 

 Stakes

For actors, musicians, performers, and travelling circuses, those that make their living by entrancing the public. Ships with an entertainment motif will likely have...

- A gaudy appearance that catches the eye

- A theatrical stage built into the main deck
